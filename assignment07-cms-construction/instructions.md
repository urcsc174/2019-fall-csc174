# Assignment 7: CMS Construction

*Due: Monday, December 9, 2019 (one week)* 

**The goal** of this assignment is to work as a team to build a working content management system using WordPress, and install it on the class production web server.

- [ ] Use [our team list (Google Sheet)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vkAjS8dGcFF_ByS9VRuI8sGagDNTyrp8JF43sN_mf4M/edit#gid=0) to establish your role in a new city-team (due today, December 2)

## Technician Responsibilities

The Technician is responsible for creating the WordPress instance on the class web server

- [ ] Use Bluehost's built-in WordPress installation tools
  - Login to our **Bluehost cPanel** (login instructions, previously provided)
  - Go to the **WordPress tools** area (select in the main menu)
  - Select the domain: **www.csc174.org**
  - Enter the path using your **city-team** name (e.g. **rochester**)
  - Enter the Site Title as your **city-team** name (e.g. **Rochester**)
  - Set the Admin Username as: **admin**
  - Set the Admin Password as: [same as we always use]
  - You can leave the Admin email blank
  - Click **Install WordPress** (ignore errors, if any)
  - Then go to **csc174.org/[city-team]** to see your handiwork

- [ ] Setup the WordPress instance<br>*Note: it's weird but yes - you seemingly have to re-enter a lot of the information you entered in the previous step.*
  - Select **English (United States)** as the language
  - Enter the path using your **city-team** name (e.g. **rochester**)
  - Set the Admin Username as: **admin**
  - Set the Admin Password as: [same as we always use] (then click to confirm use of "weak password")
  - Enter your (technician) email address
  - Click **Install WordPress**
  - Login with the admin account
- [ ] Find your way to the Settings area and make the following changes (clicking "Save Changes" as you go)
  - Change the **subtitle** to something (anything) else
  - Set the homepage to display: **A static page** ("Sample Page" for now)
  - Do *not* allow people to submit comments on new posts 
- [ ] Setup **user accounts** for the other team members
  - The "role" for the other users must be appropriate for what they need to do (read the rest of the instructions to figure that out)

Note: When the site is setup and working on the class web server, the Technician's job is mostly done.  However, if something was done incorrectly from a technical standpoint - or if the website gets messed up by one of the other team members, the **Technician is responsible** to fix it! 

Also, it would be nice if the Technician helps the IA upload and arrange the content.

## Designer Responsibilities

The Designer is responsible for selecting and setting-up the Theme for the WordPress website, and then ensuring that the presentation of the content meets design standards (page design principles).

- [ ] Select a **theme** for the CMS - preferably one that demonstrates a classic page pattern and one that gives several customization options
  -  When you chose the theme - make sure it makes sense, i.e. adds value to the content as provided from the Information Architect (which will be about your City)
  -  Learn how to use the theme and customize it appropriately for your City

Note: the Designer will have to continue to work with the website after the IA gets the content.  Even though most of the design and layout of the website is controlled by the Theme, **the Designer will still be graded on the presentation of the  content** using the C.R.A.P. principles.  Awkwardly presented content will cause the Designer to lose points!

## Information Architect Responsibilities

- [ ] The topic of the website must be the **City for which you are a member** of your city-team.  The content about your city can come from anywhere - just remember to cite the sources in a logical place in the website.

- [ ] The website must have at least four webpages: a homepage, at least two more pages of content, plus a page of "articles" about the city.
  - The website must use a "static" homepage and have at least two other static webpages of content. 
  - The website must also have a page made up of "posts" (that will be referred to as "Articles") There must be at least three articles (posts).

Note: one of the typical IA mistakes when using a CMS is to let the system and theme make choreography choices for you.  Be aware of what shows-up where, and how the navigation works.  (You'll be graded on it.)  Even though most of the design and layout of the website is controlled by the Theme, you are still required to incorporate good use of ontology, taxonomy, and choreography.  Unstructured or "loose" content will cause the IA to lose points!

## Submit the Assignment

- [ ] Everyone on the team must make a submission in Blackboard, in the assignment:<br> **Assignment 7: CMS Construction**

- [ ] In the submission you must provide the following information:

  - **Your city-team name**
  - A list of **everyone's name** in your team (including your own) **and their role** (IA, designer, or coder)
  - A link to the **website**
  - <s>A link to the **repository**</s>

REQUIRED: in Blackboard, do not write the required information in the comments section.  Use the "Write Submission" area
