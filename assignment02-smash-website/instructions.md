# Assignment 2: Smash Website
*Due: Monday, September 23, 2019 (one week)*

**The goal** of this assignment is to get a little more experience building a website as a team.  This is an activity you need to perfect because all team assignments for the rest of the semester require you to be very comfortable working with tools like this:

- **Slack** - to communicate with each other remotely & asynchronously (using *private* channels)
- **Localhost** - to work independently
- **GitHub** - to sync your independent work

This assignment is different compared to Lab 2 because this time, everyone on the team makes a separate submission in Blackboard and will be graded as individuals. 

The content for this website will come from another city-team's **Lab 2: "Flash" Website**; you can mix and match anyone's Lab 2 - but not your own.

Also note: the quality of this website only needs to rise to the standard of CSC 170 quality, i.e. the bar for the content and design is relatively low.  Still, you should try to make it look and work well.  

## Suggested Steps

1. Everyone: refer to [our shared Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vkAjS8dGcFF_ByS9VRuI8sGagDNTyrp8JF43sN_mf4M/edit#gid=0) to confirm who's who on your team.  

2. Using your *private* team channel in Slack, confirm who's doing what.
   - Note: if you don't have a private team channel setup in Slack, do so.
   - Also note: the prof can't actually tell if you're using Slack or not.  Honestly, you can communicate with each other any way you want.  But you should use Slack to get the experience using it because that's what folks use in the industry these days.
   
3. The **Technical Coder** should setup the repository and add the other team members as contributors, then the entire team should sync the repository to their localhosts

   *NOTE: the respository needs to be setup and the team needs to be able to sync with it **by end of day TODAY (Monday, September 16)**; if not, the Coder will be "fired" by the Professor and someone else on the team will pick-up their responsibilities*

4. The **Information Architect (IA)** should take a guess at the document structure based on how the content will *probably* need to flow, and then setup the HTML pages as soon as possible and sync it with the repo.

   *NOTE: the HTML documents (whether they're .html or .php files) need to be setup and ready for the rest of the team to sync **by end of day Wednesday, September 18**; if not, the IA will be "fired" by the Professor and someone else on the team will pick-up their responsibilities*

5. As soon as the repo and webpages are available from the Coder and IA, the **Design Artist** should start stitching together a *new* CSS
   - Note: this time, the website's layout and formatting need to be DIFFERENT than the professor's look and feel from Assignment 1
   - Hint: the design does not need to be incredibly fancy - basic use of techniques from CSC 170 is good enough for this assignment; feel free to get "inspiration" from anywhere on the web

6. The **IA** and the **Designer** continue to flesh out the content and design while the **Coder** installs the current page menu highlighters

   - Note: just like with Lab 2, there needs to be TWO separate menu systems, and each one needs to operate correctly with it's own current page AND SECTION highlighter (look around for inspiration!)

WARNING: At some point (early on or late in the process), the **Coder** needs to frack the HTML into PHP includes where appropriate.  Be careful, changing files names will trip-up the other team members!  Have them stop and wait until the site is re-configured, then have everyone re-sync so they can continue work.  (Use Slack to coordinate this.)

7. Last step: the **Coder** needs to upload the finished website to the class web server

8. NEW: each team member must go to Blackboard and make a submission in the correct area based on the role(s) they did for this assignment

   - Note: refer to the instructions at the bottom for the requirements on submitting the assignment in Blackboard.  Follow the instructions else lose some points there!

## Technical Requirements

The final product of this exercise must meet the base-line requirements for a quality, "bullet proof" website per CSC 170.  Among other things, the website must...

- [ ] Have **PHP Includes** to factor-out common elements from each webpage


- [ ] Have navigation elements that **indicate which is the current page and section** 
- [ ] The HTML, CSS and JS code, files and file system must be clean and follow **industry best practices and standards**

### Installation

*For the Technical Coder to do...*

- [ ] **The website must be installed** on the class web server using the following web server credentials, below.

Note: each team will use the same FTP account. Be careful *not* to disturb other teams' files.

```
FTP Server (a.k.a. Hostname): ftp.csc174.org
FTP Port: 21
FTP Username: assignment02@csc174.org
FTP Password: [same as before - ask the prof if need be]
```
- [ ] When you FTP-in to the account, create a folder using the name of your **city-team** and place your website *directly* in there

## Submit the Assignment

To get credit for your work:

- EVERYONE on each city-team submit a link to your website in Blackboard, in the assignment: **Assignment 2: Smash Website**
- [ ] Along with your link write in the **Write Submission** area (*not* the comments box):
  - **Your city-team name**
  - A list of **everyone's name** in your team (including your own), and...
  - Next to everyone's name **indicate everyone's role on the team** (IA, designer, or coder)
  - A **link to your team's repository** (which should be set to public)
