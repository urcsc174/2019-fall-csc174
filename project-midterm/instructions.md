# CSC 174 Midterm Practical

*Due: Wednesday, October 23, 2019 (one week)*

The point of this take-home practical ("exam") is to work independently and demonstrate your understanding of the concepts and technologies we've covered in CSC 174 so far.

Although the nature of web development is collaborative, the intent for this exam is to demonstrate *your* abilities to build a website independently.  Still however, you may "get inspiration" and even help from other websites and other students, but be very careful.  

- Copying someone else's code in large quantities without attribution is considered plagiarism. 
- Having someone else write your code is considered cheating.

Instances of plagiarism or cheating will be treated as such and submitted to the University's Board on Academic Honesty.  So be good!

## Requirements

From a very high level, you need to: create a **small website** (at least THREE pages, can be more) that demonstrates your understanding of:

- The role of an **Information Architect**
- The role of a **Website Designer**
- ...and all the **technical standards and best practices** that you learned in CSC 170.

### Information Architecture Requirements

*NOTE: the "goals" listed below are very important!  They inform you about how you should use the four corners of the Z-Pattern.*

- **Pick a topic** - any topic - and build a small, informational website
  - the content you use must be **unique** to anything you did in CSC 170, and **unique** to anything anyone has done in CSC 174. 
  - [ ] The **primary goal** of the website is to just *present information* about the topic, i.e., get the user to read more about it
  - [ ] The **secondary goal** of the website is to get users to *sign-up for a newsletter* 
    - Note: you need to *entice* users to sign-up
    - Also note: the newsletter sign-up is NOT the primary goal of the website!

*NOTE: you do not have to implement the newsletter sign-up with a PHP script or database.  (Actually, that'll be a future Lab Assignment.)  You only have to create an HTML form and embed it in your website.  (The "submit" button can be non-functional and you do NOT have to create a "thank you" page.)*

- [ ] Create your HTML pages using the HTML5 specification and demonstrate your understanding of good structure and semantic use of HTML tags
- [ ] Arrange the content to demonstrate your understanding of:
  - An **ontology** within a chosen domain
  - Implementation of a clear and consistent **taxonomy**
  - Creation of a logical and easy to follow **choreography**
- [ ] Write about (explain) your choices in a **readme.md** file

### Design Requirements

Create a design around your topic that demonstrates your understanding of:
- [ ] Use of the **C.R.A.P. principles** as needed to enforce the meaning of the content ...you need to demonstrate at least three of the four principles
- [ ] Implementation of webpage layouts using both a **Z- and an F-pattern** to help users understand and process information  ...you need to demonstrate both
  
  - *Note: do NOT use a **CSS Framework** ...we'll work with CSS Frameworks later in CSC 174*
- [ ] Implementation of a **legible and readable** website design to increase the duration of user interaction and increase comprehension ...you need to install **two well-paired fonts** and demonstrate your understanding of typography

- [ ] Arrange your custom CSS code using any **CSS Architecture** (a standard architecture or your own variation)
      
- [ ] Write about (explain) your choices in the **readme.md** file

  - Explain your application of the Z-Pattern - why you put what you did in each quadrant
  
  - Explain your application of the F-Pattern - why you laid out what you did, from left-to-right
  
  - Describe the C.R.A.P. principles that exist in your website and explain what they achieve
  
  - Explain why you chose the fonts you did (and don't ever say, "because I like them.")
  
  - Explain the structure behind your CSS Architecture
  
  NOTE: Don't just describe what can easily be seen in the website.  The goal is to *explain WHY* you made the choices you did.  And keep these explainations short, simple, and to the point.  TL;DR will lose points.

### Technical Requirements

- [ ] All HTML and CSS must **validate within reason**; all PHP must work without error
- [ ] File naming conventions and file sizes must follow **industry standards**
- [ ] Demonstrate your ability to use **PHP Includes** to factor out a reasonable amount of common-code across the webpages
- [ ] In your **readme.md** file - nothing is required from a technical aspect however: you can describe any worthwhile or interesting technical aspects of your website 

Note: use of a repository is not required for this assignment.  You'll submit your **readme.md** file in Blackboard along with the rest of your midterm practical.

## Submission Requirements

You will **NOT** install this website on the class web server (or anywhere online)! 

- [ ] On or before the due date ZIP (compress) your finished website along with your readme.md file and submit it in Blackboard
