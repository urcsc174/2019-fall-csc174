# Lab 2: "Flash" Website

*Due: <s>today - Wednesday, September 11, 2019 (75 minutes)</s> Monday, September 16, 2019*

**The goal** of this lab is to work as a team to combine three students' initial personal websites into one cohesive website as quickly as possible.

*Note: in this exercise, the term "flash" does not refer to Adobe Flash; rather the idea of "sudden"*

**The purpose** of this lab is to demonstrate how working with a team of web developers is better than working alone using these common industry tools:

- **Localhost** - to work independently
- **GitHub** - to sync your independent work with the rest of the team
- **Slack** - to communicate with each other remotely and asynchronously (not so much for this lab, but in the future, on the major assignments)

## Requirements

The final product of this exercise must meet the following requirements:

- [ ] The entire team must use a GitHub repository
  - **Coder:** setup the repo and make sure everyone can sync it to their desktop (using GitHub desktop software)
- [ ] Three students' initial personal websites must be combined to create a **twelve page website plus a new index page** (thirteen webpages, total)
  - **IA:** organize the files in the file system; create the new index page; alter the HTML in all webpages as needed to create a cohesive (normal) website
- [ ] There must be a new, *main menu* in *addition* to the existing menus (two NAV elements on each page except the home page)
  - **IA:** create the new main menu and make sure it works and makes sense throughout the website
- [ ] There needs to be **links back to the original** Assignment 1 websites in some appropriate place(s) (you decide where)
  - **IA:** add the links where you think it makes sense
- [ ] The HTML, CSS and JS code, files and file system must be clean and follow **industry best practices and standards** (note: "industry best practices" includes the use of PHP Includes as appropriate)
  - **Designer:** install one CSS (to rule them all!) and make sure it works correctly throughout the website, including the new main menu (which you'll probably need to code from scratch)
  - **Coder:** make sure the entire website works normally/correctly, and make sure all the HTML and CSS  pass W3C validation (within reason); also make sure the website is optimized and all file and folder names are correct. 

### Installation

- [ ] **The team** (typically the Coder) **must install the website** on the class web server using the following web server credentials, below.

Note: each team will use the same FTP account. Be careful *not* to disturb other teams' files.

```
FTP Server (a.k.a. Hostname): ftp.csc174.org
FTP Port: 21
FTP Username: lab02@csc174.org
FTP Password: [ask the prof]
```

- [ ] When you FTP-in to the account, create a folder using the name of your **city-team** and place your website in there

## Submit the Lab

To get credit for your work:

- ONE of you (typically the Coder) must submit a link to your website in Blackboard, in: **Lab 2: "Flash" Website**
- Along with your link write in the **Write Submission** area (*not* the comments box):
  - **Your city-team name**
  - A list of **everyone's name** in your team (including your own), and...
  - Next to everyone's name **indicate everyone's role on the team** (IA, designer, or coder)
  - A **link to your team's repository** (which should be set to public)

# Suggested Steps

1. Everyone: refer to [our shared Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vkAjS8dGcFF_ByS9VRuI8sGagDNTyrp8JF43sN_mf4M/edit#gid=0) to confirm who's who on your team.  
3. The **Coder** needs to setup the repository and add the other team members as contributors, then the entire team should sync the repository to their localhosts
4. The **IA** needs to arrange the 12 HTML (.php) files and create a quick HTML shell for the new homepage.  
4. The **IA** needs create a new main menu (a separate NAV element) and install it (just the HTML) on all 13 webpages.  The **IA** also needs to gather and/or create some content for the new homepage.  
5. As soon as the webpages are available, the **Designer** needs to start stitching together the CSS.
6. The **IA** and the **Designer** continue to flesh out the content and design while the **Coder** installs the current page menu highlighter.
7. Late in the process, the **Coder** needs to check the HTML and install *PHP includes* where appropriate.  Be careful, changing files names will trip-up the other team members!  If creating new *include* files, have the rest of the team STOP and wait until the site is re-configured, then have everyone re-sync so they can continue work.  (Normally, you would use Slack to coordinate this.  For today, just sit next to each other.)
8. Last step: the **Coder** needs to upload the finished website on the class web server.
9. The **Coder** needs to create a submission in Blackboard on behalf of the team.
