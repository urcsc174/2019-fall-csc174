***Technical***

  - [ ] **No unused files**
  - [ ] Files of certain types (e.g. images, CSS, includes) must be properly sorted into **sub-directories**
  - [ ] **Folder names and filenames** must be logical and make sense for what they contain (and the first page of the website must be named: **index**)
  - [ ] **Image file(s)** must be properly optimized and appropriately sized for the web

### Installation

- [ ] You must install the website on the class web server using the following web server credentials, below.
