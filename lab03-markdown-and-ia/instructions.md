# Lab 3: Markdown and Information Architecture

*Due: Wednesday, September 18, 2019 (today)* 

There are two goals of this exercise: (#1) practice putting together content into a meaningful structure (information architecture), and (#2) practice using "markdown."

For this exercise you need to gather sets of content from three separate and very different sources.  

- **Recommended:** go to Wikipedia.  Locate *three* different topics that interest you. 
- Even though the sources need to be very different, think of some *common thread* - something they *do* have in common.  (Be creative.)  E.g. cars, trains, and airplanes …they're all modes of transportation
- You'll need to gather a certain amount of text and some images (at least three images, resized to relatively small sizes as needed)

Regarding *markdown*, here are some references:

- [Github Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/)
- [Wikipedia: Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)


- You can also Google things like "markdown syntax" or "markdown images" - there are lots of people who have written about it


Also, it's not required but you can find free WYSIWYG markdown editors.  The professor uses: [Typora](https://typora.io/).  

Also also, you can create an `.md` file directly in GitHub, online, in your repository.  While in a repository in GitHub, just click the "Create new file" button.  Be sure to name it **readme.md**  

## Requirements

- [ ] The filename must be: **readme.md**
- [ ] All the content in the file must be marked-up using markdown (which isn't much ...that's why they call it "markdown", but you must demonstrate that you understand how it's supposed to be used)
  - You will also need embed the images you got into the markdown document; look-up the syntax regarding how to do that; make sure the iamges
- [ ] At the top of the markdown document, create and style some heading information:
  - **Your name**
  - **The title**: what this document is about - the "domain" …whatever the thing that the three separate topics have in common

- [ ] Then (under the heading information) write a short paragraph (75 words or so; can be a single sentence ) describing in a little more detail something about the three topics and what they have in common.  
- [ ] Then (under the short paragraph) create a section with a header: **Ontology**; in the ontology section create a list of classes and relationships (the "triples") using bullets (and sub-bullets if it makes sense to use them)
- [ ] Then (under the Ontology section) create a section with the header: **Taxonomy**; in the taxonomy section create a list of terms that will be used in the content using bullets and sub-bullets
- [ ] Then (under the Taxonomy section) create a section with the header: **Choreography**; in the choreography section write an explaination (can be a simple sentence) explaining how the content is presented - it's order, and why
- [ ] Then, in the rest of the markdown document, you need to insert your content (whatever you chose) and create a good document structure using the principles of information architecture. 
  - All told, you should have a document with around 500-700 words or so.  (I'm not going to count the words, but you should be in the ballpark.) 
  - Everything described in the Ontology, Taxonomy, and Choreography should be represented in the content
  - Hint: you should end-up with several headings, sub-headings, stuff like that with text and images arranged within.  (Hint: lots of headings and sub-headings is GOOD)


When you're done...

- [ ] Create a submission in Blackboard, in **Lab 03: Markdown and Information Architecture** and upload your **readme.md** file **and image files**, or if you wrote your markdown file directly in GitHub, submit the link to it in Blackboard
