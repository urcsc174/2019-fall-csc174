# Lab 4: Advanced Layout

*Due: Wednesday, October 2, 2019 (before next class)* 

The goal of this lab is to practice creating and coding a two-dimensional layout using CSS Grid, and a one-dimensional layout using CSS Flex.

## Instructions

### Part 1

- [ ] **Sketch** a two-dimensional layout with at least seven elements (more is better)
  - Note: the sketch will have to be turned-in
  - Do NOT replicate the professor's examples found in the Course Documentation website
- [ ] At least one element needs to span colunns, and one element needs to span rows (more is better)
- [ ] Within one element (preferably a big one) there needs to be at least five elements in a one-dimensional horizontal layout
  - This is so you can demonstrate coding Flex items inside a Grid cell

### Part 2

- [ ] **Code** the sketched layout in HTML and CSS 
- [ ] Use some basic formatting so we can see the boxes
  - It is okay to code in a single HTML using an embedded STYLE tag in the HEAD  
  - Position the elements in the layout using CSS Grid properties (for the two dimensional layout) and CSS Flex properties (for the one dimensional layout)

### Part 3

- [ ] **Add content** (from anywhere) and change the HTML structural elements appropriately to reflect the semantic value of the parts; also use apporpriate class names
- [ ] The content must make sense altogether, i.e. not random
  - The HTML structural elements and class names from online code generators might use DIVs and non-useful class names; you need to change them

## Turn-in the Lab

- [ ] Create a submission in Blackboard, in **Lab 04: Advanced Layout**
  - In addition to your webpage file(s), attach your sketch (a digital picture or any format)
