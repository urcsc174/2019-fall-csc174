# Assignment 4: Odd Student Out

*Due: Wednesday, October 9, 2019 (one week)* 

**The goal** of this assignment is to build a new two-page website that uses everything new we've learned so far in CSC 174, plus all the best practices and standards from CSC 170.  

**The focus** of this assignment is on the Designer who must create a design for the website that uses the C.R.A.P. principles and their understanding of Z-Patterns and F-Patterns.

- Refer to the [Assignment 2 directories](http://csc174.org/assignment02/) or the [Assignment 3 directories](http://csc174.org/assignment03/) on the class web server to find content
- Use  [our team list (Google Sheet)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vkAjS8dGcFF_ByS9VRuI8sGagDNTyrp8JF43sN_mf4M/edit#gid=0) to establish your role in a new city-team

Remember: you have to **complete each role (IA, Designer, Coder) at least once** during the semester. This is a **team assignment**, however you will be graded for the work you do as an individual within the team.  

## General Requirements

The team is responsible for delivering a website that meets the following requirements:

- [ ] At least two webpages.  A home page (index) that uses a **Z-pattern**, and another page that uses an **F-pattern**
- [ ] In the website there must be information about **three students**, two of whom have something in common, and one who is different
- [ ] **LOOK!! This is new -->** On the home page, there must be an introduction to the topic (domain) that includes a full **viewport sized JavaScript-powered slide show**.
  -  Hint: Google something like **fullscreen jquery slideshow** ...or something like that

Note: the **Information Architect** and **Designer** must work together to decide how the content will be structured in HTML (the IA's job) and how the presentation layer will convey the Z- and F-patterns (the Designer's job).  

Also, the **Information Architect** and **Coder** must work together to implement the slide show on the home page.

### Information Architect's Requirements

The IA must deliver basic "content and intent" by **Friday (by end-of-day or so)**:

- [ ] The **intent** must be described in a **readme.md** file that contains the following information

  - Name of the **city-team**
  - List of the team members and **who is doing what**
  - **Link to the team's website** on the class webserver which won't be available immediately but will exist eventually. (You need to add this before you turn-in the assignment on Wednesday.)
  - A short description of the website's **domain**
  - A short description of the website's information architecture in terms of its: **ontology**, **taxonomy**, and **choreography**

Note: the purpose of the information architecture in the readme is to provide guidance for the designer (and to a lesser extent, the coder), so write it for *them*!

- [ ] The **content** must be represented in a set of **initial documents, structured in HTML** in the HTML files.  There must be enough structure and content for the Designer and Coder to begin work.
  - The IA will be graded on the semantic naming of files and folders, and semantic usage of *all* HTML tags.
  - In addition to the first-level tags that surround content (e.g. P tags, H tags, et cetera), all content must be positioned (nested) in structural elements (e.g. main, section, article, et cetera).
  - Note: even though the Designer and Coder may change the tags used in the HTML documents while they work, the IA will be graded for the HTML structure in the final delivery.  So the IA must watch how the team members add or change their HTML documents!  If they make mistakes in the HTML, the IA will lose points for it. 

### Design Artist's Requirements

The Designer's due date is the same as the due date for the overall website: **next Wednesday**:

Note: the Designer needs to take direction from the IA regarding the *intent* of the content.  Other than that, the Designer must *make their own choices* for which they will be graded.

- [ ] The Designer must clearly demonstrate understanding of the **C.R.A.P. principles**
  - Design choices such color choices and use of the box model (remember that?) will determine the Designer's grade.
- [ ] The Designer must implement the **Gutenberg rule** on the home and sub-pages, specifically:  Z- and F-patterns, respectively
- [ ] The Designer must implement a **CSS strategy** that is easily understood and obvious.  The designer must write a section of the **readme.md** file that describes the architecture.

### Coder's Requirements

The Coder's due date is the same as the due date for the overall website: **next Wednesday**:

- [ ] The website must follow industry best practices and standards which includes:
  - The file structure and files used for the website
  - HTML and CSS validation (within reason)
  - File sizes and feasibility of the code to run quickly and reliably in modern web browsers
  - Use of PHP includes to factor out common elements (within reason)
  - Correct implementation of the FULL VIEWPORT JavaScript-powered slide show on the home page
- [ ] The website must be installed on the BLUEHOST class web server in a folder with a name based on the team city that you're in. 

### Web Server Credentials

Each team will use the same FTP account. Be careful *not* to disturb other teams' files.

```
FTP Server (a.k.a. Hostname): ftp.csc174.org
FTP Port: 21
FTP Username: assignment04@csc174.org
FTP Password: [same as before - ask if you need to be reminded]
```

## Submit the Assignment

Note: even though you worked as a team, everyone will be graded as an individual based on the work you did. To get credit for your work:

- Everyone on the team must make a submission in Blackboard, in the assignment:<br> **Assignment 4: Odd Student Out**

- In the submission you must provide the following information:

  - **Your city-team name**
  - A list of **everyone's name** in your team (including your own) **and their role** (IA, designer, or coder)
  - A link to the **website**
  - A link to the **repository**

  *NOTE: <u>do not</u> write this information (above) in the comments section in Blackboard.  Use the "Write Submission" area*
