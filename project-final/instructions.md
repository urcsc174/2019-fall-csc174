# CSC 174  Final Exam - Practical

*Due: Friday, December 20, 2019 (last day of exams)*

The point of this take-home exam is to work independently and demonstrate your understanding of the concepts and technologies we've covered all semester in CSC 174.

## Requirements

From a very high level, you need to: create a **small website** that demonstrates your understanding of:

- The role of an **Information Architect**
- The role of a **Website Designer**
- The role of a **Technician** (Front- and Back-end Website Developer)

*Note: the number of pages in the website is up to you; that's one of the things you have to decide as IA*

### Step 1: Content

- [ ] YOU choose your domain; **send a DM in Slack** to the professor with your domain proposal
  - You probably want to do this a quickly as possible because you should not start building your website until *after* you've submitted your **domain proposal** <u>and</u> you have received a response from the professor.
  - Note: your domain proposal will be graded ...so you need to know what a domain is!
    - One sentence or so will suffice
  - Based on your domain, **the professor** (not you) will define the following by replying to your DM in Slack (you should receive a reply within 24 hours)
    - The Ontology
    - The Taxonomy
    - The Choreography
    - ...and other technical requirements

*Note: the intent of this part of the assignment is to have you gather content from multiple sources to support the information architecture, and to construct it in HTML.  You can use any source(s) from the web to cobble together the content, but whatever you do, just make sure it supports the ontology, taxonomy, and choreography as defined by the professor.*

*Also as always, remember to cite your sources in a logical place in the content.*

### Step 2: Construction

Build the website and demonstrate your understanding of the following:

- [ ] **Information architecture** ...specifically, how to implement one
- [ ] Good **design choices** that make sense for the information architecture
  - Remember: design should be driven by the content, not the other way around
- [ ] **Technical proficiency**
  - Ensure that the entire website meets **web standards** and follows **best practices**

NOTE: everyone will find that the information architecture that the professor sends you will require you to implement the following, at the very least:

- [ ] A slideshow
- [ ] A working HTML contact form that writes data to a database
- [ ] A "back-end" to the website that provides four-function access (i.e. C.R.U.D) to the database behind a password-protected wall

**Construction Notes:** although the nature of web development is collaborative, the intent for this exam is to demonstrate *your* abilities to build a website independently.  

- Copying someone else's code without attribution is considered plagiarism. 
- Having someone else write your code is considered cheating.

Instances of plagiarism or cheating will be treated as such and submitted to the University's Board on Academic Honesty.  

For this exam you must **NOT** upload anything to the class web server nor any other publicly accessible server.  Also, you must not share completed code with anyone.  This is an exam!  

## Turn it in

Do **not** upload your files to the class webserver or share your files in any way

- Export your MySQL database on your localhost to a file named **export.sql**
- [ ] Compress (ZIP) all your files including the .sql file into a single ZIP file
- [ ] Upload your compressed file to the assignment in Blackboard titled: **Final Project** on or before the due date.

*Note: a readme.md file is not required for this project unless you think some of your design choices need to be explained.  If so, include a readme.md file with your submission in Blackboard.*
