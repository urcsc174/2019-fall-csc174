# Lab 13: WordPress (local)

*Due: Monday, December 2, 2019 (today, in-class)*

The purpose of this lab  is to practice installing and using the popular Content Management System: WordPress. 

## Install WordPress

- On your localhost, **create a new database and associated user**.
  - You can call it whatever you want, e.g. lab13wordpress
  - You can use one of the lab computers for this exercise; we will *not* need these files again
- Download WordPress from www.wordpress.org and copy the files into your local MAMP or WAMP installation
- Run the WordPress installation
- Login to WordPress

## Install a Theme

- Using the WordPress "Themes" utilities (under Appearance/Themes) use the "Add New Theme" widget to select, install, and activate a new theme.
  - Do NOT use one of the pre-installed Themes; click the **Add New** button and find a new, interesting (and fairly simple) Theme to install and activate

## Customize the Site

- Using the Settings area, go into "General" and change the **Site Title**, **Tagline**, and some of the other settings
- Explore - and play with - the other areas under Settings; make some changes
  - Good thing to learn: turn-off the blogging features of this website

## Load Content

- Copy & paste content from anywhere, upload images
  - Add some "media"
  - Create some **Posts**
  - Create some **Pages**
